# Contributing Guidelines

## Introduction

Thank you for considering contributing to Docsible! We appreciate your effort and contributions can help the project grow and improve.

## How to Get Started

- **Fork the Repository**: Click on the "Fork" button at the top-right corner of the repository page on GitHub.
  
- **Clone the Repository**: After forking, clone your forked repository to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/[Your-Username]/docsible.git
    ```
  
- **Add Remote Repository**: Set up the upstream remote to keep your fork in sync with the original repository.

    ```bash
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/docsible/docsible.git
    ```

## Workflow

1. **Sync Your Fork**: Before you start, always make sure your local repository is up-to-date with the upstream repository.

    ```bash
    git pull upstream main
    ```

2. **Create a Branch**: Create a new branch for each task, feature, or bugfix.

    ```bash
    git checkout -b [branch-name]
    ```

3. **Make Changes**: Make your changes and commit them. Follow a clear and concise commit message convention to document your changes.

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "[Your Commit Message]"
    ```

4. **Push Changes**: Push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub.

    ```bash
    git push origin [branch-name]
    ```

5. **Create a Pull Request**: Once the changes are pushed, create a pull request from your forked repository to the original repository.

6. **Review and Merge**: After a review, your changes may be merged into the original repository.
